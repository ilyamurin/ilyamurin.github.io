                <li>Don‚Äôt get the second dog unless you have GREAT control of the first dog, otherwise you‚Äôll learn that two dogs is more than twice as difficult</li>

                <li>Many people get two dogs so that their dog will have a friend, problem is is that usually what happens is it‚Äôs more of a reason to leave both of them home</li>

                <li>Dog and human food is a myth.  Its Dry food that comes in the bag and its not human food we are feeding them, just food</li>

                <li>If a dog jumps on your and the trainers solution is to turn around and ‚Äúwait‚Äù the dog out, ask them respectfully to leave your house</li>

                <li>If you are always working on the basics how can you ever get to the advanced work</li>

                <li>If a training technique you are still using isn‚Äôt showing results, then you need to change technique or theory behind which you are applying your strategy</li>

                <li>First time we make a demand verbally, the second time we always respond.  If this is not followed your dog will feel the need to pay attention when you say things</li>

                <li>Just because a dog is a dog doesn‚Äôt mean it has good ‚Äúdog language‚Äù, after all it was raised by humans</li>
