            <h1>Obedience (Dog Handler 101)</h1> 
        <p>The Art of bringing both human and dog together.<br>  We will teach structure to the dog and skill sets to the owner.</p>  
        <p>Each lesson works on a new skill set designed to build your confidence in your abilities and your dogs ability to understand you.</p>  
        <p><span class="bold">On average in 5 lessons you will have a dog OFF LEASH.  Thats right!!</span></p>
        <p>
            <ol class="main_list">
                <li>First Lesson – In House</li> 
                <li>Second Lesson – Loose Leash Walking</li>
                <li>Third Lesson – Sit / Stay</li>
                <li>Fourth Lesson – Streets Safety</li>
                <li>Fifth Lesson – Off Leash</li>
            </ol>
        </p>    
        <p>(All lessons are done with all the dogs biggest distractions around)</p>
        <p>In each lesson we will cover:<br> 
        dog psychology<br>
        k9 body language<br>
        street / city agility<br> 
        how to read terrain properly<br> 
        as well as covering all the questions you have on various dog problems.</p> 
        <p>In the end,<br> my goal is that you will feel superior and confident to how you felt when we met just a few short lessons before.</p>  
        <p><span class="bold">Behavior Modifications –</span><br>
        Dogs have needs, if there needs are being met than we as the dogs owner shouldn’t have any issues.<br>  If you are having trouble or what I classify as “resistance” in your dog.<br>  We need to figure out how better to serve that need.</p>  
        <p>Each dog is a bit different,<br> and environment plays a role but generally there is always something we can do to modify the situation.</p>  
        <p><span class="bold">Puppy 1 + 2 –</span><br> We all love puppies!<br>  But we take a step back is love enough or is there something else we can be giving them that is going to enrich their lives forever…<br> That is Direction!  During</p> 
        <p><span class="bold">Puppy 1</span><br> we go over all the basics of dogs.<br>  From sicknesses, feeding, bathroom needs, gnawing, biting, scratching, stealing from tables,<br> running out of doors, eating shoes, uncontrollable barking, jumping, and most importantly “The Meaning of the Word NO”.<br>  Many dogs know what this means but have no respect for the word.<br> Its vital from a young age to implement this in the dog so that they can have an easier time joining our society.<br>  
        Its all about leading our new responsibility in a direction that will make them a successful adult dog (because one day they will be)</p> 
        <p><span class="bold">Puppy 2</span><br> is designed to be an off leash or basic outdoor session with the dog.<br>  While outdoors we will go over how to make your dog want to follow you.<br>  The most precious time you can spend with a dog is outside so we’ll continue with the training to expand it outdoors.</p>  
        <p><span class="bold">Security and Protection K9’s</span><br>
        Dogs for thousands of years have been used to alert and protect their human counterparts.<br>  When training a dog to protect they need to have confidence and knowledge of the subject of Combat.<br>  After completeing the obedeince portion in the Jordan Knight Development Program, dogs are now ready to start more advanced training, in this case Bite work.</p>  
        <p>Dogs are designed to bite on command.<br>  Unlike many militaries and law enforcement organizations every dog I teach has the ability to “Out” (let go) on command.</p>
